Basys 3 XADC Demo
==============
  
Description
--------------
This project is a Vivado demo using the Basys 3's analog-to-digital converter ciruitry, switches, LEDs, and seven-segment display, written in Verilog. When programmed onto the board, voltage levels between 0 and 1 Volt are read off of the JXADC header. The 16 User LEDs increment from right to left as the voltage difference between the selected channel's pins gets larger. The seven-segment display shows the voltage difference between the selected channel's pins in volts. SW0 and SW1 select which XADC channel is displayed, as shown in the table below. See the Basys 3's [Reference Manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual) for more information about how the Artix 7 FPGA's XADC is connected to header JXADC.

| XADC Channel | JXADC Pins             | SW0 Position | SW1 Position |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| AD6          | JXADC1(P) / JXADC7(N)  | Down         | Down         |
| AD14         | JXADC2(P) / JXADC8(N)  | Up           | Down         |
| AD7          | JXADC3(P) / JXADC9(N)  | Down         | Up           |
| AD15         | JXADC4(P) / JXADC10(N) | Up           | Up           |
  
Requirements
--------------
* **Basys 3**: To purchase a Basys 3, see the [Digilent Store](https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/)
* **Vivado 2018.2 Installation**: To set up Vivado, see the [Installing Vivado and Digilent Board Files Tutorial](https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/installing-vivado/start).
* **MicroUSB Cable**
* **Wires and a Circuit to Measure**

Demo Setup
--------------
1. Download and extract the most recent release ZIP archive from this repository's [Releases Page](https://github.com/Digilent/Basys-3-XADC/releases).
2. Open the project in Vivado 2018.2 by double clicking on the included XPR file found at "\<archive extracted location\>/vivado_proj/Basys-3-XADC.xpr".
3. In the Flow Navigator panel on the left side of the Vivado window, click **Open Hardware Manager**.
4. Plug the Basys 3 into the computer using a MicroUSB cable.
5. In the green bar at the top of the window, click **Open target**. Select "Auto connect" from the drop down menu.
6. In the green bar at the top of the window, click **Program device**.
7. In the Program Device Wizard, enter "\<archive extracted location\>vivado_proj/Basys-3-XADC.runs/impl_1/XADCdemo.bit" into the "Bitstream file" field. Then click **Program**.
8. The demo will now be programmed onto the Basys 3. See the Introduction section of this README for a description of how this demo works.

Next Steps
--------------
This demo can be used as a basis for other projects, either by adding sources included in the demo's release to those projects, or by modifying the sources in the release project.
